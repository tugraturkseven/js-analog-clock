# How to clone

Open a command-line interface (CLI) on your computer, such as the terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, if you want to clone the repository to your desktop, you can type:

cd ~/Desktop

Clone the repository by typing the following command:
git clone https://github.com/tugraturkseven/js-analog-clock.git


Once the repository is cloned, you will see a new folder named "js-analog-clock" in your current directory.

Open the "js-analog-clock" folder and open the "index.html" file in your web browser.

Note: Some browsers may block the running of JavaScript code when opening a local HTML file directly. To avoid this, you can run a local web server or use a tool like "Live Server" to serve the HTML file.

You should see the analog clock displayed on the web page, showing the current time based on your system clock.

You can customize the clock by editing the CSS and JavaScript files in the repository. For example, you can change the colors, font sizes, or the design of the clock hands.
